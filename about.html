    <h1>About</h1>
    <h3>Career</h3>
    <p>I've spent 16.5 years in electronic component distribution.
        I started my career in products as a Product Assistant, entering information and assisting the Product Managers on the Semiconductor and Opto-embedded teams with tasks.
        <br>
        I then moved to a team that was a bit of the jack of all trades to all Product Managers.
        <br>
        After that, I moved to Marketing where I helped to build microsites focusing on individual parts for promotional purposes.
        <br>
        My last job on the Products floor was in Asset Management. I coordinated with the Product Managers, suppliers, and the warehouse to close out issues with stock returns, incorrect shipments, and stock rotations and scrapping of product.
        <br>
        I was then recruited to help on the Bill of Materials team, quoting large volume quotes on the Sales floor.
        <br>
        Through the years I became the most productive member of the team and was promoted three times, eventually becoming the team Coordinator.
        <br>
        I then left that company to build a team doing similar work.
        <br>
        <h3>School</h3>
        I earned my Bachelor's in Business Administration (BBA) from Texas Wesleyan University.
        <br>
        I was a founding member of the Zeta Xi chapter of Kappa Alpha Order.
        I was also the third president, second vice president, second secretary, and first treasurer.
        <br>
        <h3>Free Time</h3>
        During my free time, I enjoy playing with my dog, Margo.
        <br>

        <br>
        I also enjoy putting on YouTube videos in the background and ignoring them, reading, and spending time with friends and family.
