    <h3>Career</h3>
    <img class="about-img" src="https://www.freedmansonline.com/cdn/shop/files/CloseUp_Option1_83a0d726-b287-4ca0-a891-1af3c5503b00_1245x700.jpg?v=1712781947" alt="Cubicle">
    <p>I've spent 16.5 years in electronic component distribution.
        I started my career in products as a Product Assistant, entering information and assisting the Product Managers on the Semiconductor and Opto-embedded teams with tasks.
        <br>
        I then moved to a team that was a bit of the jack of all trades to all Product Managers.
        <br>
        After that, I moved to Marketing where I helped to build microsites focusing on individual parts for promotional purposes.
        <br>
        My last job on the Products floor was in Asset Management. I coordinated with the Product Managers, suppliers, and the warehouse to close out issues with stock returns, incorrect shipments, and stock rotations and scrapping of product.
        <br>
        I was then recruited to help on the Bill of Materials team, quoting large volume quotes on the Sales floor.
        <br>
        Through the years I became the most productive member of the team and was promoted three times, eventually becoming the team Coordinator.
        <br>
        I then left that company to build a team doing similar work, however, due to market forces and a reorganization, I and about half the staff were laid off.
